# Udacity_Data_Analyst_2
Data Wrangling

This is the second of three projects completed for Udacity's 
Data Analyst Nanodegree programme. It is not meant to be a 
deep dive into the dataset but an exercise in the gathering,
assessing, and cleaning of data.

After some deliberation I chose datasets that contain polling
data and gun related deaths in each U.S county. I chose this 
pair of datasets because they could be merged by county and
have an overlap in time range.

No prizes for guessing the results.
